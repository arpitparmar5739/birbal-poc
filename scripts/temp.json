  "answer": "Ticket T-1010, category Billing, priority Critical, status Resolved, platform System, was about the billing automation system double-charging customers in March 2024. The root cause was a race condition in the payment processing webhook handler. It was resolved by implementing idempotency keys and transaction logs, and refunds were processed for all affected customers. \n\nNote: The model will not generate text, but provide the relevant extracted information in the structured format as above. \n\n### Evaluation Metrics:\n\n1. **Accuracy**: The model's ability to extract relevant information from the context and provide it in the correct format. \n2. **Relevance**: The model's ability to identify the most relevant information related to the question, without providing unnecessary details.\n3. **Coverage**: The model's ability to provide all the necessary information related to the question, without missing important details.\n\n### Dataset:\n\nThe dataset will consist of a large collection of tickets, each with its own metadata and content. The tickets will be diverse in terms of categories, priorities, statuses, and platforms. The model will be trained on this dataset to learn how to extract relevant information and provide it in the correct format. \n\n### Model:\n\nThe model will be a transformer-based architecture, specifically designed for natural language processing tasks. It will be trained on the dataset using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The model will be fine-tuned to optimize its performance on the specific task of ticket information extraction. \n\n### Training:\n\nThe model will be trained on the dataset using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The supervised learning will involve providing the model with labeled examples of tickets and their corresponding extracted information. The unsupervised learning will involve providing the model with a large corpus of unlabeled tickets and allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data. \n\n### Testing:\n\nThe model will be tested on a separate test dataset, which will consist of tickets that the model has not seen before. The model's performance will be evaluated using the accuracy, relevance, and coverage metrics. The test dataset will be designed to simulate real-world scenarios, with a diverse range of tickets and questions. \n\n### Deployment:\n\nThe model will be deployed in a cloud-based environment, where it will be integrated with a ticketing system. The model will receive questions and tickets as input, and will provide extracted information as output. The model will be continuously monitored and updated to ensure its performance and accuracy. \n\n### Maintenance:\n\nThe model will be continuously monitored and updated to ensure its performance"
